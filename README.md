# ATEM sample command generator

This project is used to generate sample commands to be used by unit tests to verify command parsing and serialization

It builds on the work of [LibAtem](https://github.com/LibAtem/LibAtem/) as it is [tested against the official SDK](https://github.com/LibAtem/LibAtem.ComparisonTests) to ensure correctness.

The code in this repo is fairly generic but is currently solely used for [atem-connection](https://github.com/nrkno/tv-automation-atem-connection)
